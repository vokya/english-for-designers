### 2) What did you like least about this course?
I think we discussed abstracts more than was needed.

### 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?
- I learned how to use markdown. 

- I think I became more comfortable speaking and presenting. 

- I learned how important plain text and accessibility are in content.

### 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

My favourite assignments were the thesis, storytelling, and home page presentation. It was interesting and inspiring to watch the work of others. I also remember an activity in group at the very start of the course about the description of a picture. That was cool.

### 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?
I would say I am proud of the work I’ve done during this course mostly presentation,because I used to struggle with that in the past.

I`ve learned about myself as a designer, from voice of tone to reviewing my casestudies. 

### 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?
I am regretting to not express more concrete feedbacks even I was thinking about it. 
And also I wanted to make more flashy and interactive thesis presentaion like the ones you showed us but there was no time.🥵

I have honestly no comment. Than you for the great year and reassuring us about our abilities and being supportive and always ready to help! 🫶🏻

Nothing comes to mind.🤷🏼‍♀️

### 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
I woud recommend to do assingments on time, give feedback to others an don’t be afraid to express yourself, Justin makes it feel like a really safe space where is okay to make a mistake.😊

# Year End Review

### 1) What did you like most about this course?
 I liked the easy-going, fun, and supportive atmosphere.😊 

### 2) What did you like least about this course?
I think we discussed abstracts more than was needed.

### 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?
- I learned how to use markdown. 
- I think I became more comfortable speaking and presenting. 
- I learned how important plain text and accessibility are in content.

### 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

My favourite assignments were the thesis, storytelling, and home page presentation. It was interesting and inspiring to watch the work of others. I also remember an activity in group at the very start of the course about the description of a picture. That was cool.

### 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?
As someone who has struggled with presentations in the past, I'm proud of what and how I've presented it.

### 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?
I've learned about myself as a designer, from voice of tone to reviewing my casestudies.

### 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?
Even though I was thinking about it, I regret not giving more concrete feedback to others.
And also I wanted to make a more flashy and interactive thesis presentation like the ones you showed us but there was no time.🥵 

### 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?
I have honestly no comment. Thank you for a great year. Thank you for reassuring us about our abilities, being supportive, and also always ready to help! 🫶🏻

### 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?
I'd suggest more teamwork during classes or tasks that encourage interaction. 

### 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
Justin makes it feel like a really safe space where mistakes are okay, so you should make assignments on time, give feedback and don't be afraid to express yourself.😊

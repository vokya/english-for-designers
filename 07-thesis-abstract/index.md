## Abstract

This bachelor's thesis brings attention to the importance of schools' visual identity which is in the Czech Republic unfortunatelly largely neglected. The objective is to develop a new visual identity for the future primary school located in the village of Měšice. The work aims to create a visually recognizable style that will be attractive and functional for future students, parents, and school staff. Additionally, the project provides this educational facility with a marketing solution that will communicate the brand's special values and benefits. In the theoretical part, this thesis focuses on aspects of creating a brand identity in the field of education and fully exploring its untapped potential and leading marketing practices. The practical part deals mainly with the creation of a unified visual style and its coherent application across all communication channels of the school. This includes the school's website, social media, the interior, and educational materials.

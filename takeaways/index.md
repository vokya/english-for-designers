# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. I`ve learned useful tips on how to show and sell my work better and I gain a little bit of confidence  
2. I`ve got to know myself better us a designer as I went through describing work process and defining my proffesional voice and tone
3. I`ve became more familiar with accesibility for the first time and now I am more considerate in new projects
4. to think more about content before designing  
5. to be kind to reader, use accesible langugae rather then long academic phrases

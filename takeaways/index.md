# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. useful tips on how to show and sell my work better and I gain a little bit of confidence
2. more about myself as a designer as I went through describing my work and defining my professional voice and tone
3. to be more familiar with accessibility for the first time and now I am more considerate in new projects
4. to think more about plain written content before designing
5. to be kind to a reader, use accessible language rather then long fancy vocabulary

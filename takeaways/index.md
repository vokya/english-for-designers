# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. useful tips on how to show and sell my work better and I gain a little bit of confidence  
2. more about myself better as a designer as I went through describing work process and defining my proffesional voice and tone
3. to be more familiar with accesibility for the first time and now I am more considerate in new projects
4. to think more about plain written content before actual designing  
5. to be kind to a reader, use accesible langugae rather then long fancy vocabulary

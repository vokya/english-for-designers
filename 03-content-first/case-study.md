# Rebrand of Viola Theatre
## November-January 2022 
Ideation, identity, branding, social media strategy, print layouts

We colaborated with the small but very significant Prague Viola theatre located on Národní třída in the Art Nouveau building. The theatre is focused on chamber performances inspired by literary texts. The place was exceptionally important during the 70s when it served as a poetic vinery for intellectuals and artists.

Unfortunately, visual communication has shattered over time a has become more and more fragmented and neglected. The client’s request was to upgrade communication to be more attractive and united. A logo, website, all printed materials, and a social media strategy was required. The main objective was to appeal to younger viewers, but also not to offend the usual older visitors. You can see original communication below.

In our design solution, we decided to enhance special aspects of the theater such as the unique closeness to the artists and the beauty of the Czech language. 

We introduced a little play to the project by expressing physical clossenes in the theatre with taglines like" Be even closer to us in January" on the program. Intimity was also used in typography.

The colors, that I particularly enjoyed,are in the form of warm gradients inspired by theater lights, also the cozy atmosphere and abstract emotions during the performance.

We hope that our design and marketing choices would come across as attractive and accessible for visitors of every age. The new approach to social media would raise the awareness of the brand among younger clients that are in my opinion no less interested in theatre. 

My role in the team of three (together with Jan Jiráček and Eunice Sojková) was to focus on the potential of social media, printed programs, and cocreating the whole conception. 

This project was surprisingly challenging because of the creative freedom in comparison with serious corporate projects. We were as a team often overwhelmed with ideas and inspiration until we found a strong communication story.

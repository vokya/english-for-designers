## My Story

This is me

I am a graphic design student currently pursuing the final year of my bachelor's studies. Since I was born I was fond of arts and crafts of all kinds such as painting, photos, pottery, and even tattoo making.
In my work as a designer, I am mostly focused on visual identities. My dream job would probably revolve around the use of illustration and would serve beyond commercial causes. As you will see in my portfolio my works are quite diverse in style. I am still trying to explore all possible disciplines of graphic design and find a place where I fit the best. I love to educate myself in courses and improve my skills. I view myself as genuine and caring person which I belive can benefit to any creative and team work.

When I am not behind a computer screen, I love to move my body in yoga poses, spent time with my two dogs outside, or discover new coffee shops with my friends.🧘🏼‍♀️🐶🐶☕

## My Story

This is me

I am a graphic design student currently pursuing the final year of my bachelor's studies. Since I was born I was leaning towards arts and crafts of all various kinds such as painting, photos, pottery, and even tattoo making.

In my work as a designer, I am mostly focused on visual identities. My dream job would probably revolve around the use of illustration and would serve beyond commercial causes. As you will see later in my diverse works, I am still trying to explore all possible disciplines of graphic design and find a place where I fit the best. I love to educate myself in courses and constantly improve my skills. I hope to bring a little thoughtfulness to every project that I am part of.

When I am not behind a computer screen, I love to move my body in yoga poses, spent time with my two dogs outside, or discover new coffee shops with my friends.🧘🏼‍♀️🐶🐶☕

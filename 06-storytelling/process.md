I started similarly as from the talk about Web design, I just put everything on paper and make a mind map of my ideas. Then I put some that resonated with me the most on sticker notes and started to group them to see if there is a possible connection. I made eventually some themes that I felt like topics I would like to dive deeper into.

### Mind map

At this point, I was thinking about what these things have in common and what my title should be. I came up with a few things that I've learned as a designer and a person because that was basically what I wrote about. I tried to make the talk mostly about design however, whether I liked it or these things are an inherent part of my life, and that's the reason I added person too. Then I made some draft slides. Now I am in the stage of drafting the text and trying to write something about every chapter.

### Chosen ideas on sticker papers
- [First draft slides](Untitled.pdf) were basically including chapters on orange sticker notes and on the yellow ones is what the particular chapeter talked about.

### Narrowing it down

- As I wrote about every chapter I quickly realised there is no chance to put this much content to one short presentation so I had to decide what to focus on. I chose a chapter about perfectionism and I also covered a little bit of struggling in your 20s.

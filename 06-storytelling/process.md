# Few things I've learned as a designer and a person

I started similarly from the talk about Web design, I just put everything on paper and make a mind map of my ideas. Then I put some that resonated with me the most on sticker notes and started to group them to see if there is a possible connection. I made eventually some themes that I felt like topics I would like to dive deeper into. At this point, I was thinking about what these things have in common and what my title should be. I came up with a few things that I've learned as a designer and a person because that was basically what I wrote about. I tried to make the talk mostly about design however, whether I liked it or these things are an inherent part of my life, and that's the reason I added person too. Then I made some draft slides. Now I am in the stage of drafting the text and trying to write something about every chapter.

# Few things Ive learned as a designer and a person
## Process of my work 

- Read [the article](â€¦) <!-- index.md -->

<!-- Treat this as the case study to your article/talk/presentation. Document, discuss, and show your process (mind maps, chunking, draft and revised content, links to resources, etc.) -->
<!-- Preparing a conference talk: https://adactio.com/journal/14363 -->
<!-- A refresher about case studies: https://thegymnasium.com/courses/take5/taking-your-portfolio-case-studies-to-the-next-level -->

I started similarly like from the talk about Web design,I just put everyhing on the paper and make mind map of my ideas. Then I put some that resonated with me the most on sticker notes and started to group them to see if there is a possible connection. I made eventually some overall themes that I felt like topics I would like to dive deeper to. At this point I was thinking about what these things have in common and what my title should be. I came up with Few things that Ive learned as a designer and a person because that was basically what I wrote about. I tried to make about design whether I liked it or  these things are inherent part of m life and thats the reason I added person too. 
Then I made some draft slides. Now I am in the stage of drafting the text and try write something about every chapter.

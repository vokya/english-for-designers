Hi! Let me guide you through the creation of this presentation. I started as the creator of Web design talk by putting everything on paper and making a mind map of my ideas. Then some that resonated with me the most made it to sticker notes and were grouped according to their topic and possible connection. I eventually found some themes I wanted to dive deeper into.

### Mind map

At this point, I was thinking about my title. After a while, I came up with a Few things that I've learned as a designer because that was basically what I wrote about. I am not sure if I'm happy with the title now but it is what it is.🤷🏼‍♀️ It was meant partly personal however I tried to make the talk mostly about design. 

### Chosen ideas on sticker papers
[Colorful sticker notes with ideas grouped together](Untitled.pdf) were basically including chapters on orange sticker notes and on the yellow ones is what the particular chapter talked about.

### Narrowing it down

As I wrote about each chapter I quickly realized there is no chance to put this much content into one short presentation so I had to decide what to focus on. I chose a chapter about perfectionism and I also covered a little bit of struggling in your 20s.
